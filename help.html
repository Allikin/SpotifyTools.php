Playlist option:
In Spotify, right click the playlist you want to check for duplicates and click copy. Past it in the playlist field by rightclicking the field and clicking Paste.
Another option is to select it and press ctrl-c on your keyboard, then place the marker in the field and press ctrl-v on your keyboard
Last, but definitly not least - you can just drag the playlist from Spotify to the playlist field. 

This option will also find possible dubplicates that do not share Spotify address (URI). Note that it will include these possible duplicates in the new playlist, as the serach is not perfect and can list false duplicates.
Unfortunaltely due to technical restrictions set by Spotify, this option will only accept 1000 tracks from your playlist, and it does not handle local tracks.
For larger playlists, you must use the track list field, described below.

Track list option:
In Spotify, go to your playlist and select all tracks by right clicking a track and choosing Select all, or press ctrl-a on your keyboard.
Copy the tracks by right clicking and choose Copy. To paste the tracks into the tracks list, right click the track list field and choose Paste.
Another option is to press ctrl-c on your keyboard to copy the tracks, then place the cursor in the track list field and press ctrl-v to paste.
Lastly you can simple click and drag all the tracks from Spotify to the track list field.

This option does not have a limit when it comes to number of tracks, and it handles local files, but it will not find duplicates that do not share address in Spotify (URI).
